# UNet-for-Radar-Imagery

## About this project
This is Tensorflow based project using U-Net Architecture to map flooding using Sentinel-1 imagery

## Dataset
You can download our dataset in this link https://www.kaggle.com/dimskeee/unet-segmentation-using-radar-imagery, that includes thousands of tiles that used to train, test, and validation

## Implementation
This is a map that came from visual interpretation (manually)

**Note:** Training for this model was done on a RTX 2060 Super 6GB

## Prediction
This is a map that came from prediction from our model to the same dataset (automatically)
